 * point A and a high point B. The space is warped such that point A and point B represent the same physical position
 * in space even though the linear distance between the two points is far away. A typical example of warp space is
 * demonstrated by a compass. A compass has a low point of 0-degree and a high point of 360-degree but these two
 * points are at the same physical position (NORTH).
